# TripMapper GUI

TripMapper is a simple, customizable GUI that enables users to plot and animate paths consisting of GPS coordinates on an interactive map, utilizing JMapViewer from OpenStreetMap. After selecting a CSV file containing coordinates and time; an image marker for current position; their desired animation speed; and whether or not to include time idling at a location, users can play their animation. In addition to displaying a label and color-coded path indicative of speed, users can choose to pause or restart the animation.

To run the program, a .jar file, sample dataset, and marker image are provided.
